To run the code succesfully, the environment you create to start app.py in
needs to have:
numpy
scipy
flask
requests

This can be installed by writing "pip install NAME" in the terminal

You will also need to ensure that the file structure is as follows

Spintest-Backend Folder
    app.py
    SpinTest Folder
        SpinTestClass.py
        Teff.py
        Rcalculator.py
        Goalseek.py
        freqfunc_v2.py
        ConvertSI.py
